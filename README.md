CodeRunner
==========

There are various websites out there that allow for students who are new to programming to learn more about programming. This is often in the form of a REPL (Read Eval Print Loop), and is not very friendly to new programmers. Instead this application allows for a visual representation of code, which allows for students to create games of all levels of intricacy.
